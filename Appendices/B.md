# **Appendix B: Common Errors and Solutions**

When developing in Unity, it's common to encounter various errors, especially as projects grow in complexity. Here are some of the most frequent errors and how to solve them.

## **1. NullReferenceException**
- **Error**: This occurs when your code tries to access an object that has not been instantiated or has been destroyed.
- **Solution**: Always check if an object is null before using it in your script. For example:
  ```csharp
  if (myObject != null) {
      // Safe to use myObject
  }
  ```
  Also, ensure that all object references are correctly assigned in the Inspector.

## **2. MissingComponentException**
- **Error**: You are trying to access a component that isn’t attached to the GameObject.
- **Solution**: Make sure the required component is attached, or use `GetComponent<T>()` to check if the component exists before accessing it:
  ```csharp
  var myComponent = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
  if (myComponent != null) {
      // Safe to use Rigidbody
  }
  ```

## **3. Scene Not Loaded in Build**
- **Error**: When you try to load a scene, but it doesn’t exist in the build settings, you'll get an error that says the scene couldn’t be loaded.
- **Solution**: Go to `File -> Build Settings` and make sure the scene is added to the build list. Without this, Unity cannot load the scene during runtime.

## **4. Inconsistent Physics Results**
- **Error**: Objects behaving unpredictably when using physics, such as bouncing too much or clipping through surfaces.
- **Solution**: Adjust the physics settings under `Edit -> Project Settings -> Physics`. Make sure that rigidbodies and colliders are set up properly, and consider using Continuous Collision Detection for fast-moving objects to prevent clipping.

## **5. Performance Issues**
- **Error**: The game stutters or runs slowly, especially in complex scenes.
- **Solution**: Use the Profiler to analyze performance. Common solutions include:
  - Reducing polygon count for 3D models.
  - Using efficient texture sizes.
  - Implementing object pooling to avoid frequent instantiating and destroying of GameObjects.
  - Reducing the number of lights or using baked lighting.

By addressing these common errors early, you can avoid frustration and keep your development process smooth.
