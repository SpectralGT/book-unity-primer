## **13.1 Case Study: Developing a 2D Platformer – *Hollow Knight***

When Team Cherry set out to create *Hollow Knight*, a 2D platformer in the Metroidvania style, they faced numerous challenges typical of indie game development. What resulted, however, was a masterpiece that captivated millions of players worldwide, largely due to the seamless use of Unity's toolset. *Hollow Knight* exemplifies the power of Unity when creating intricate, immersive worlds in 2D.

### **Concept Creation**
The essence of *Hollow Knight* lies in its world-building. Players navigate through the hauntingly beautiful, interconnected underground realm of Hallownest. The eerie, hand-drawn aesthetics set the mood for a vast world filled with secrets, challenges, and rich lore. From the outset, Team Cherry sought to craft an experience that was both visually engaging and mechanically complex, a balance that many indie teams struggle with. Unity, particularly its robust 2D tools, allowed them to create an engaging and smooth platformer experience while minimizing the technical challenges of sprite management and animation.

Unity’s **Tilemap** system became central to the level design. By dividing levels into smaller, reusable tiles, the team could quickly and efficiently craft large, sprawling areas. This system also enabled dynamic environments that shifted as the player progressed, contributing to the game’s immersive feel. The game’s aesthetic—a mixture of melancholic gloom and vibrant action—was brought to life using Unity’s **Sprite Renderer** and **Animation System**.

### **Level Design and Player Interaction**
For any platformer, the fluidity of player movement and the responsiveness of controls are paramount. Team Cherry invested heavily in ensuring tight controls for *Hollow Knight*. Unity’s physics engine, though typically associated with 3D games, was adapted to create the weighty yet responsive feel of the main character’s movements. The developers fine-tuned jump arcs, dash mechanics, and attack hitboxes to create a satisfying gameplay experience, relying on Unity’s highly customizable 2D physics settings.

The game’s non-linear design also made Unity’s **Scene Management** features vital. Players often backtrack through areas, unlocking new paths as they gain abilities, which is a hallmark of the Metroidvania genre. Unity allowed for seamless transitions between scenes without loading times, keeping players engaged and immersed in the sprawling map.

### **Key Challenges**
One of the greatest challenges was optimizing performance, particularly for console releases. *Hollow Knight* was eventually released on multiple platforms, including Nintendo Switch, which presented limitations in processing power. Here, Unity’s **profiler tools** were invaluable. The developers used the profiler to identify bottlenecks in frame rate, memory consumption, and CPU usage, enabling them to fine-tune performance without sacrificing visual quality or gameplay smoothness.

Another challenge was managing the game’s intricate animation system. With hundreds of enemy types, all requiring unique animations, the **Animator Controller** was pivotal in organizing and managing the various states each character could exist in. Unity’s flexible animation tools allowed Team Cherry to focus on creativity without getting bogged down in technical hurdles.

### **Results and Lessons**
The success of *Hollow Knight* is a testament to Unity’s ability to support indie developers in creating high-quality, content-rich games. The developers learned that while Unity offers powerful tools for optimization and performance, early planning and asset management are crucial to ensuring a smooth development process. By leveraging Unity’s 2D systems and iterating through feedback cycles with players, Team Cherry delivered a polished, critically acclaimed product that set a new benchmark for indie platformers.

## **13.2 Case Study: Building a 3D Adventure Game – *Ori and the Will of the Wisps***

Moon Studios used Unity to craft *Ori and the Will of the Wisps*, a game that masterfully blends tight platforming mechanics with stunning visuals and a deeply emotional narrative. This case study highlights how Unity’s 3D engine and toolset were utilized to bring a vibrant, immersive world to life while ensuring smooth gameplay across various platforms.

### **Conceptualization and World-Building**
*Ori and the Will of the Wisps* is a follow-up to *Ori and the Blind Forest*, expanding on the first game’s success with more complex mechanics, a deeper storyline, and enhanced graphics. Moon Studios aimed to create a large, interconnected world with a unique aesthetic—a lush, fantastical environment filled with vibrant colors, flowing animations, and meticulously crafted lighting.

Using Unity’s **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**, the developers were able to achieve high-quality graphics while maintaining performance, especially on lower-end systems like the Nintendo Switch. The URP allowed the team to create dynamic lighting and shadows, which played a key role in setting the game’s mood and guiding players through complex environments.

### **Gameplay Mechanics**
*Ori and the Will of the Wisps* relies heavily on fluid platforming and combat. Players control Ori, a nimble spirit who navigates through dangerous terrain using a wide range of movement abilities—double jumps, wall runs, dashes, and glides. Unity’s **Character Controller** component was instrumental in building a character that could move seamlessly through the game world. The physics-based movements, coupled with precise hit detection, allowed for a satisfying and responsive gameplay experience.

In addition to movement, combat mechanics were expanded from the original game. Ori now has a range of melee and ranged attacks, and the game features a more complex enemy AI. Unity’s **NavMesh system** and **AI tools** were used to implement intelligent enemy behavior, ensuring that each enemy type presented a unique challenge.

### **Key Challenges**
Given the game’s emphasis on artistic presentation, Moon Studios faced significant challenges in maintaining performance without sacrificing visual quality. Unity’s **LOD (Level of Detail) system** allowed them to adjust the complexity of assets based on the player’s distance, optimizing rendering performance for different hardware configurations. For the game’s more visually intensive scenes, Unity’s **Culling System** helped manage memory usage by ensuring that only visible objects were rendered at any given time.

Another challenge was the integration of complex animations for both Ori and the various NPCs. Unity’s **Timeline tool** was used extensively to coordinate intricate cutscenes, ensuring that they played out smoothly without disrupting gameplay.

### **Results and Lessons**
*Ori and the Will of the Wisps* demonstrated Unity’s versatility in handling large-scale, visually ambitious projects. The game’s success on both high-end and low-end systems showcases Unity’s strength in scalability. Moon Studios found that while pushing the engine’s graphical capabilities was possible, a balanced approach between aesthetics and performance was essential to ensure a consistent player experience.
